# Replaces the old PostToolUse(Edit|Write|MultiEdit) formatter, which was blind to
# any edit that did not go through those tools — `sed -i`, a codemod, a generator,
# anything run via Bash. That blind spot is what shipped unformatted files to CI.
# git sees all of them, whoever wrote them.
#
# Running once at end of turn also stops Prettier from reformatting a file
# between two edits to it, which invalidated the old string in the second edit.

# Best-effort and non-blocking: errors silenced, always exits 0.
