 * them. Opting out of the auto-approver means "let me drive the dialog under test", not
 * "let me answer the core's preamble in every scenario".

 * Auto-approve transient permission/alias dialogs in the renderer.

 * Installs a MutationObserver via `addInitScript` (runs on every navigation)
 * and once immediately via `evaluate` (covers the already-loaded document).
 * Watches `document.body` for any element matching one of the approve
 * test-ids and clicks the inner `<button>` as soon as it appears. Fires
 * independently of Playwright actions — works even while the test is doing
 * non-interactive work like cycling through tabs.
 *
 * Whether a click actually fires is gated by the `AUTO_APPROVE_FLAG_KEY`
 * localStorage value, read live on every candidate node (default: enabled) —
 * but only for `GATED_APPROVE_TESTIDS`; `ALWAYS_APPROVE_TESTIDS` are answered
 * whatever the gate says.
 * On a fresh-per-test app the observer is only installed when the test isn't
 * `@manual-permissions`, so the gate stays at its default. On the shared
 * worker-scoped authenticated page the observer is installed once and the
 * per-test soft-reset flips the gate via `setDialogAutoApprove` — installing
 * for normal tests, disabling for `@manual-permissions` — so state never
 * bleeds across tests on the shared page.
 *
 * Some of these ids sit on the `<button>` itself and others on a wrapper div, so
 * the lookup accepts either. Where it is a wrapper, the inner `<button>` is
 * targeted rather than the wrapper, because the wrapper takes its width from the
 * surrounding flex layout and on Windows its center can land in padding, so a
 * click would miss the button.
