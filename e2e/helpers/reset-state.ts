/**
 * Soft-reset the shared, worker-scoped authenticated session back to a clean
 * `/dashboard` baseline between tests — WITHOUT re-running the QR/bot pairing.
 *
 * localStorage is restored to a BASELINE SNAPSHOT captured right after the
 * worker signed in — `captureLocalStorageBaseline` — rather than cleared or
 * preserved key by key. The reset is `clear()` + write the snapshot back.
 *
 * This deliberately names no storage keys at all. Both list-shaped alternatives
 * rot: a list of keys to CLEAR has to grow every time the app persists
 * something new, and when it doesn't the forgotten key silently bleeds state
 * into the next test (recent chats, the chat request preference and the
 * update-check versions had all been leaking that way). A list of keys to
 * PRESERVE has to track host-papp's session keys, which the SDK renames between
 * releases — this file used to document them as `SsoSessionsV3` while the SDK
 * had moved to `SsoSessionsV4`. The snapshot needs neither: whatever a freshly
 * signed-in worker had is by definition the clean authenticated baseline, and
 * the SSO/session layout stays entirely host-papp's business.
 *
 * It is also stricter than a preserve-list — a test that MUTATES a baseline key
 * (theme, settings) is rolled back too, not just one that adds new keys.
 *
 * Health-check + fallback: if after the reload the app is not authenticated on
 * `/dashboard` (session lost, renderer/process dead, or a prior test logged
 * out), we fall back to a full relaunch + re-sign-in so a poisoned previous
 * test can't cascade into the rest of the worker.
