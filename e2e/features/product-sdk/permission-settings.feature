Feature: Permission settings entity pages

  The Settings → Privacy area exposes two permission entity views: per-app
  (/settings/privacy/apps/<id>) listing an app's requested permissions and per-
  permission (/settings/privacy/permissions/<id>) listing the apps that use a
  permission. Both are populated only by apps that have requested a permission,
  so each scenario first drives host-playground to grant a device permission
  (the auto-approver clicks "Allow Always" — no @manual-permissions here), then
  asserts on the settings pages.
