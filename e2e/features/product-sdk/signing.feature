  Scenario: TC-8.3.1 createTransaction request returns a signed transaction
    Given the user is authenticated
    And the test product "host-playground" is opened
    And the user clicks the "Signing" tab
    When the user runs "Create Transaction with Product Account"
    And the user confirms signing
    Then the result contains "0x"

  @allure.id:14864
  Scenario: TC-8.1.3 Rejecting a raw-message request surfaces a rejected result
    Given the user is authenticated
    And the test product "host-playground" is opened
    And the user clicks the "Signing" tab
    When the user runs "Sign Raw Message"
    And the user rejects signing
    Then the result contains "Denied"

  @allure.id:14862
  Scenario: TC-8.1.1 Sign raw message works correctly in product sandbox
    Given the user is authenticated
    And the test product "host-playground" is opened
    And the user clicks the "Signing" tab
    When the user runs "Sign Raw Message"
    And the user confirms signing
    Then the result contains "Message signed"

  # TC-5.4.2 is the Module-5.4 (Product SDK / Sandbox) sibling of TC-8.1.1
  # (id 14862): the same sign-raw flow, distinct TestOps case in the sandbox
  # sub-area. Kept thin — it reuses the proven-stable Sign Raw Message path.

    And the user confirms signing

  # SKIPPED: TC-5.4.3 is the Module-5.4 sibling of TC-8.1.2 (id 14863) — the same
  # post-reload re-sign flow, which the 8.1.2 author found irredeemably flaky:
  # signing again after a product reload does not reliably surface "Message
  # signed" (the first sign in TC-5.4.2 / TC-8.1.1 is stable). Same root cause,
  # same conclusion. Left manual until the post-reload re-sign flow is hardened.
