Feature: Skip onboarding

  Background:
    Given the app is launched
    And the user skips onboarding

  # The "log in" half is covered by reaching the login entry point (the
  # onboarding QR screen); actually pairing needs the signing bot (auth project).

    When the user opens settings from the user menu
    Then the host is on the settings page
    When the user opens the login flow from the user menu
    Then the QR code is visible on onboarding screen
