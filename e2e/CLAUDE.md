# E2E Tests

BDD-style Electron tests using `playwright-bdd` with Gherkin `.feature` files. See [README.md](README.md) for full architecture
diagram and setup guide.

## Structure

`e2e/features/` (Gherkin scenarios) → `e2e/steps/` (step definitions) → `e2e/page-objects/` (Page Objects)

**Feature files are classified into one folder per Playwright project, and the `authenticated` project is further
grouped by feature area.** Each project's `defineBddConfig()` registers its folder with a glob, so a new `.feature`
is picked up by dropping it in the right folder — no config edit needed (except for a brand-new project).

```

├── smoke/            app-launch, onboarding, main-view, address-bar, sandbox-health
├── auth/             sign-in, session-identity, onboarding-network

```

Security probes are TypeScript Playwright specs (`e2e/tests/security/*.e2e.ts`), not Gherkin. The folder a file
lives in does not determine which project runs it — the **first tag** (`@smoke`/`@auth`/`@authenticated`/…) does —
but folder and project are kept aligned for clarity.

## Test Projects

Projects: `smoke → auth → authenticated`, plus `product-sdk`, `chat`, `security`, `link-navigation`, and `browser` (independent)

- `smoke` — basic app launch, onboarding, dashboard (fresh Electron per test)
- `auth` — sign-in and logout flows via signing bot (fresh Electron per test, `AUTOTEST=true`)
- `authenticated` — tests requiring a signed-in session. **One Electron is signed in once per worker and reused across all its tests**; between tests a soft-reset (`helpers/reset-state.ts`) wipes per-test state, preserves the session keys, reloads, and lands back authenticated on `/dashboard` — no re-pairing. Runs `fullyParallel`; each worker claims its own permanent deterministic identity (`desktopauthd<workerLetter><osSuffix>`, see "Bot identities" in Rules). Tests that end/mutate the session opt out with `@isolated` (throwaway fresh app + own sign-in).
- `product-sdk` — product sandbox API tests via host-playground (Accounts, Signing). Feature files in `e2e/features/product-sdk/`, shared steps in `e2e/steps/test-product-sdk.steps.ts` (all steps bind to `test` from `e2e/fixtures/test-product-sdk.ts` — which extends `authenticatedTest`).
- `chat` — all chat features grouped in one project under `e2e/features/chat/`. Mixed fixtures because chat has three flavours of test:
  - `chat-p2p.feature` — single-client contact search against a signing-bot peer identity. Uses `authenticatedTest` via `chat-p2p.steps.ts`.
  - `chat-p2p-pair.feature` — two Electron clients (Alice + Bob) with random per-worker bot identities (generated inline, overridable via `BOT_USERNAME_ALICE` / `BOT_USERNAME_BOB`), signing in once per worker. Uses `chatPairTest` via `chat-p2p-pair.steps.ts`, fixture `e2e/fixtures/chatPair.ts`. Timeout 600s — two sign-ins + on-chain chat handshake.
  - `coinflip-chat.feature` — single Electron, adds CoinFlip product widget to the dashboard and sends a chat message via the QuickChat popover. Uses `authenticatedTest` via `coinflip-chat.steps.ts`.
- `security` — sandbox isolation probes (independent, own fixtures)
- `link-navigation` — host-router/webview navigation behavior. Uses a local HTTP fixture (`e2e/test-products/link-tests/`) served on an ephemeral port; tests open `localhost:<port>` via the address bar so no DotNS/IPFS/chain is required. No auth.
- `browser` — browser-chrome features (zoom, find-in-page, history, tabs, …) automated against TestOps plan 900. Reuses the same `link-tests` local product as a real product webview (so product-route guards are active) — no auth, no chain. Menu-driven features are triggered via `clickMenuItem` (`e2e/helpers/electron.ts`), which invokes the menu item's handler and sends the same IPC the accelerator would. Feature files in `e2e/features/browser/`.

## Writing Tests

### 1. Feature file

```gherkin
@smoke @allure.label.parentSuite:smoke @allure.label.suite:Feature_Name
Feature: My Feature

  Scenario: Something works
    Given the app is launched
    When the user does something
    Then something happens
```

- First tag (`@smoke` / `@auth` / `@authenticated`) determines which project runs it
- `@allure.label.parentSuite:` — must match project name (lowercase)
- `@allure.label.suite:` — Allure sub-group (underscores instead of spaces)

### Linking a scenario to its TestOps case (`@allure.id`)

Scenarios that automate a case from Regression test plan 900 on the project's Allure TestOps instance link
to it so TestOps shows coverage. The case map + current automation status live in
[docs/regression-testplan-900-cases.md](docs/regression-testplan-900-cases.md). The mechanism:

1. **Scenario name** starts with the `TC-x.y.z` id, then the case title.
2. **`@allure.id:<numericCaseId>`** tag on the scenario — the machine link. The numeric id (the `allureCaseId`)
   is in [docs/regression-testplan-900-cases.md](docs/regression-testplan-900-cases.md); it is NOT the `TC-x.y.z`
   string. allure-playwright forwards this tag and matches the result to the case on upload.

```gherkin
@authenticated @allure.id:14901 @allure.label.parentSuite:authenticated @allure.label.suite:Appearance @allure.label.feature:Theme
Feature: Appearance settings

  @allure.id:14901
  Scenario: TC-10.2.2 Switch to dark theme via user popover
    ...
```

- **One `@allure.id` per scenario** (Allure allows a single id per test). When a scenario covers two adjacent
  cases, link the primary id and note the secondary in a comment.
- A scenario that is extra coverage with no matching TestOps case stays **untagged** (add a comment saying so).
- Feature-level `@allure.id` is allowed when a single-scenario feature maps 1:1 to a case, but prefer the
  scenario level so multi-scenario features stay unambiguous.

### 2. Step definitions

```typescript
// e2e/steps/my.steps.ts
import { createBdd } from 'playwright-bdd';
import { test, expect } from '../fixtures/base';
import { MyPage } from '../page-objects/MyPage';

const { Given, When, Then } = createBdd(test);

When('the user does something', async ({ electronApp }) => {
  const page = new MyPage(electronApp.window);
  await page.doSomething();
});
```

For authenticated tests use `authenticatedTest` and `authenticatedApp`:

```typescript
import { createBdd } from 'playwright-bdd';
import { authenticatedTest } from '../fixtures/authenticated';

const { Given, Then } = createBdd(authenticatedTest);

Given('the user is authenticated', async ({ authenticatedApp }) => {
  await authenticatedApp.window.waitForURL(/dashboard/);
});
```

### 3. Page Objects

```typescript
// e2e/page-objects/MyPage.ts
import { type Page, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { TEST_IDS } from '@/shared/test-ids';
import { DEFAULT_TIMEOUT } from '../helpers/timeouts';

export class MyPage {
  constructor(private readonly page: Page) {}

  get myButton() {
    return this.page.getByTestId(TEST_IDS.myButton);
  }

  async clickMyButton() {
    await expect(this.myButton).toBeVisible({ timeout: DEFAULT_TIMEOUT });
    // HeaderButton doesn't forward rest props, so testid is on a wrapper div
    await this.myButton.locator('button').click();
  }
}
```

**Timeouts.** Never hardcode `timeout: <number>` in tests or page objects. Use one of three constants from `e2e/helpers/timeouts.ts`:

- `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT` (30s) — UI element waits, navigation, page loads
- `LONG_TIMEOUT` (60s) — heavy operations like webview/product loading
- `VERY_LONG_TIMEOUT` (90s) — sign-in flows that involve handshake + on-chain attestation

### 4. data-testid

All test IDs live in `src/shared/test-ids.ts` — single source of truth for both app components and tests.

```typescript
// src/shared/test-ids.ts
export const TEST_IDS = {
  myButton: 'my-button',
} as const;
```

`HeaderButton` and some `@novasamatech/tr-ui` components don't forward rest props. Wrap with a `<div>`:

```tsx
import { TEST_IDS } from '@/shared/test-ids';

<div data-testid={TEST_IDS.myButton}>
  <HeaderButton variant="icon" onClick={handleClick}>
    <Icon />
  </HeaderButton>
</div>;
```

### 5. Screenshots

```gherkin
Then the dashboard screenshot is taken as "my-screenshot"
```

Use `$testInfo` fixture (not the third callback argument):

```typescript
Then('the dashboard screenshot is taken as {string}', async ({ electronApp, $testInfo }, name: string) => {
  const screenshot = await electronApp.window.screenshot();
  await $testInfo.attach(name, { body: screenshot, contentType: 'image/png' });
});
```

### 6. Auto-approved permission dialogs

By default, every test auto-approves product permission/alias request dialogs
(`permissionDialogAllowAlways`, `aliasPermissionAllow`) via a renderer-side
MutationObserver installed in `e2e/helpers/dialogs.ts`. Tests don't have to know
which products may pop dialogs.

**Opt out** when the test itself needs to assert on the dialog (e.g. permission
UX tests): add the `@manual-permissions` tag to the feature.

```gherkin
@authenticated @manual-permissions @allure.label.parentSuite:authenticated @allure.label.suite:Permissions
Feature: Permission dialog UX
  ...
```

On the **shared worker-scoped authenticated page** the auto-approver can't be a
one-shot per-launch install (the page is reused). Instead the MutationObserver
is installed once at worker launch and gated by a localStorage flag
(`__e2e_dialog_auto_approve`) read live on every dialog; the per-test soft-reset
flips it via `setDialogAutoApprove` — enabled for normal tests, disabled for
`@manual-permissions` — so no dialog state bleeds across tests on the shared
page. The flag is on the reset preserve-list so it survives the
reload-with-fresh-observer.

### 6a. `@isolated` — opt out of the shared worker session

By default an `@authenticated` scenario reuses the worker's shared signed-in app
(soft-reset to a clean `/dashboard` baseline before the test). A scenario that
**ends or mutates the session** (logs out, switches network and confirms) or
needs a genuine cold start must tag itself `@isolated` — it then gets a
throwaway fresh Electron with its own sign-in (today's per-test behavior),
leaving the worker app untouched. A logout left un-tagged would log the shared
worker app out and the next test's reset would have to fall back to a full
re-sign-in; `@isolated` makes it correct by construction.

```gherkin
  @isolated @allure.id:14907
  Scenario: TC-10.3.4 Log out from the user popover ends the session
    ...
```

Currently tagged `@isolated`: the two logout scenarios in
`authenticated/settings/profile.feature` (TC-10.3.4, TC-2.3.2).

### 7. Register in config

Each project's `defineBddConfig()` in `playwright.config.ts` registers its feature folder with a **glob**, so a new
`.feature` is picked up automatically once you drop it in the matching folder — no config edit needed:

```typescript
const bddSmokeDir = defineBddConfig({
  features: ['./e2e/features/smoke/*.feature'], // smoke/, auth/, link-navigation/, browser/, chat/, product-sdk/
  steps: sharedSteps,
});
const bddAuthenticatedDir = defineBddConfig({
  features: ['./e2e/features/authenticated/**/*.feature'], // recursive — nested by feature area
  steps: [/* ... */],
});
```

Put the file in the folder for its project (and, under `authenticated/`, the sub-folder for its feature area —
`dashboard/`, `settings/`, `products/`, `networks/`, `session/`). You only touch `playwright.config.ts` when adding a
**new project** or a **new `authenticated/` area** (and even then the glob usually already covers it). If a feature
also needs a new step file, add that to the project's `steps:` array.

### 7a. Product names are labels, not full names (`helpers/dotns.ts`)

Since [paritytech/dotns#201](https://github.com/paritytech/dotns/issues/201) the dotNS suffix is **per deployment** — read
from `DotnsProtocolRegistry.tld()` — so one product is a different name on different environments. A `.feature` file
therefore names a product by its **label** and the step completes it:

```gherkin
    And the test product "host-playground" is opened
    Given the user opens "coinflipgame03" in a new tab
```

```typescript
import { AUTH_TLD } from '../fixtures/authenticated';
import { productName } from '../helpers/dotns';

Given('the test product {string} is opened', async ({ testProductPage }, label: string) => {
  await testProductPage.navigateTo(productName(label, AUTH_TLD));
});
```

- **`e2e/helpers/dotns.ts` is the only place a suffix is spelled.** It maps each `E2eEnvironmentId` to its TLD
  (`nightly` → `.paseo`, `unstable` → the fallback) and exports `productName(label, tld)` plus `DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT_ID`
  for the projects that never pick one.
- **`E2E_DOTNS_TLD` overrides the map for a run** (`E2E_DOTNS_TLD=.paseo npm run test:e2e:product-sdk`) — for when a
  deployment changes its TLD before the map catches up. It is validated against the same shape the app accepts off-chain
  (`^\.[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,62}$`), so a typo fails at load rather than as a pile of unresolvable products. It does **not**
  move `FALLBACK_TLD`, which mirrors the app's own constant and is what the no-auth projects derive with.
- **Signed-in projects** (`authenticated`, `product-sdk`, `chat`) use `AUTH_TLD` from `fixtures/authenticated.ts` — the
  suffix of the environment they sign in on.
- **No-auth projects** (`browser`, `link-navigation`) still run on an environment: they _skip_ the onboarding picker rather
  than opting out, so its default stays selected and the app resolves that network's TLD like anywhere else (verified — the
  browser project's address bar reads "Enter .paseo address" with nothing signed in). Seed with
  `networkTld(DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT_ID)`, not the fallback, or the pinned grid looks for ids nothing seeded.
- **The `link-tests` HTML fixture is templated, not literal.** Its cross-product `polkadot://` href has to end in the
  suffix the host recognises, or `decideWillNavigate` reads the link as an ordinary navigation and it replaces the tab
  instead of opening a new one. Write `{{TLD}}` in `e2e/test-products/link-tests/index.html`; `startStaticServer`
  substitutes it at startup from the `replacements` the fixture passes.
- **Literal strings stay literal.** The address-bar sanitisation fixtures (`$(localdot.dot)`, `"localdot.dot`, …) are
  malformed _input_, not product names — they are typed verbatim and must not be completed.
- **The spotlight's Tab completion is gated on the app knowing its TLD** — it will not complete a name under the fallback,
  because the completed text is routed against the settled suffix and would resolve nowhere. So assert against the suffix
  the field is _offering_ (`AddressBarPage.expectTabCompletes`, which reads the `inputModalityGhostSuffix` span) rather than
  a hardcoded one: the scenario then verifies that completion happens, on whichever network it runs.

### 8. Pre-launch product seeding (`helpers/seed-products.ts`)

A fresh session persists NO products, so cases that need recents / favorites / a
pinned new-tab grid / a pre-existing dashboard widget were unautomatable. The seed
helpers write directly into the app's Dexie DB (`polkadot-desktop-app-v1`) + the
recents localStorage, so the renderer reads them on its next boot as if the user
had committed them. No chain or auth is needed — works in the no-auth `browser`
project too.

```typescript
import { seedProducts, seedAddressBarRecents, seedDashboardWidget, seedDashboardPages } from '../helpers/seed-products';

// baseNames are full names — complete the label with the project's TLD first (see 7a).
await seedProducts(page, [{ baseName: named('coinflipgame03') }, { baseName: named('x'), withWidget: false }]);
await seedAddressBarRecents(page, [named('coinflipgame03')]); // address-bar + new-tab recents
await seedDashboardWidget(page, named('x')); // single product-widget card on `main`
await seedDashboardPages(page, [named('a'), named('b')]); // one card per page → ≥2 pages (pagination)
await seedRemoteUrlPermission(page, 'localhost:51221', 'https://example.com/'); // Open-External-URL grant
```

**`seedRemoteUrlPermission` is not optional sugar.** E2E builds pass
`promptForUnmatchedRemoteAccess: false` (`src/bootstrap.ts`), so `resolveRemoteUrlAccess`
denies any URL with no stored decision and never raises a dialog for the auto-approver to
answer. A scenario about what the host does with a _permitted_ external URL has to seed the
grant; without it the sandbox logs `External navigation denied by permission` and nothing
reaches `shell.openExternal`.

**API / gotchas for future authors:**

- **Always reload after seeding.** The helpers write through a _raw_ IndexedDB
  connection, which Dexie's `liveQuery` (behind `productsResource` /
  `subscribeToMain`) does NOT observe, and the recents state only re-reads
  localStorage on a fresh boot. So nothing reflects until `page.reload()`. In the
  `browser` project the reload restores `/dashboard` (re-skip onboarding only if it
  bounces — the `the app reloads with onboarding skipped` step does this
  adaptively); an authenticated session reloads straight back to `/dashboard`.
- **`withWidget: false`** seeds a product with no `widget` executable → its
  dashboard widget card renders the "Domain not found" body (`productWidgetNotFound`).
- **The new-tab pinned grid is hardcoded** to the labels `host-playground` /
  `coinflipgame03` / `test-dapp-01`, which the app completes with the network TLD
  — seed those three labels completed the same way (`named()` in
  `browser-seed.steps.ts`) to fill it.
- **Suggestions live in the input surface, not in the address bar.** The bar is a
  button; pressing it opens the spotlight, and `AddressBarPage` drives both halves
  (`open()` / `submit()` / `close()`). The surface renders only what is persisted —
  with nothing seeded its panel collapses, so assert on the surface (`expectSurfaceVisible`)
  rather than on the suggestions unless the scenario seeds products first. The two
  assertable sections are **Recently Opened** and **Saved**; a product already shown
  as a recent is not repeated below, so seed one of each.
- **Cleanup is free** — everything lands in the per-test fresh `userDataDir`, which
  `clearAppData()` already isolates. Nothing leaks between tests.
- **Chat session-seeding lives in a sibling helper** (`helpers/seed-chat.ts`) —
  the chat domain keeps its own standalone Dexie DB (`p2p-chat`), separate from
  `polkadot-desktop-app-v1`. See the next section.

### 8a. Pre-render chat session seeding (`helpers/seed-chat.ts`)

The live P2P attestation/handshake backend is required to establish a real chat
room (peer search → request → accept), so every UI-over-existing-data chat case
(message grouping, the message context menu, edit/reply compose, copy,
delete-conversation, room-list sorting) was unautomatable without it. This helper
writes a chat SESSION + its MESSAGES straight into the chat domain's standalone
Dexie DB (`new Dexie('p2p-chat')`), so a fully populated room renders with NO
live handshake. Uses `authenticatedTest` (single client; no chat pair needed).

```typescript
import { seedChatRooms } from '../helpers/seed-chat';

await seedChatRooms(authenticatedApp.window, [
  {
    peerId: 'seed-peer-alice',
    peerUsername: 'Alice',
    messages: [
      { text: 'Hello there', direction: 'incoming' },
      { text: 'My own message', direction: 'outgoing' },
      { text: 'Yesterday', direction: 'incoming', ageDays: 1 }, // drives date separators
    ],
  },
]);
```

**Minimal record set (verified against `src/domains/chat/p2p`):**

- A **room** row in `rooms` (keyPath `sessionId`): `{ sessionId, peerId, peerUsername, userId,
createdAt, lastUpdate }`. `sessionId === peerId`.
  The rooms stream resource queries `where('userId').equals(userId)`, so the room is
  only visible under the **signed-in user's id**.
- **message** rows in `messages` (keyPath `messageId`): `{ messageId, sessionId,
peer, timestamp, content: {type:'text', text}, status, lastUpdate }`. A message
  belongs to a room when its `sessionId` equals that room's `peerId`. `status` is
  `{direction:'outgoing', state:'delivered'}` or `{direction:'incoming', state:'seen'}`.
- **No crypto / session keys are needed.** The room renders from the rooms+messages
  resources alone; the live `manager` only needs to _exist_ (the chat list returns
  `[]` while `p2pChatManager$` is null), and it comes up post-sign-in from the local
  SSO identity even with the backend down (its subscriptions are fire-and-forget,
  `startSession` is catch-wrapped).

**API / gotchas:**

- **The seed `userId` is read at runtime** from `window.__p2pV2Debug.userId` (the
  manager publishes it). `seedChatRooms` blocks on `waitForChatManager` until that
  appears — which also guarantees the `p2p-chat` DB + object stores exist (created
  lazily on the manager's first read). So **seed only after sign-in**, never pre-launch.
- **Reload is mandatory** (same `seed-products.ts` gotcha): the rooms/messages stream
  resources read through Dexie `liveQuery`, which does NOT observe the raw IndexedDB
  writes. `seedChatRooms` reloads + navigates home + re-awaits the manager for you.
- **Use it for UI-over-data only.** A seeded room has no contact roster / session keys,
  so any action that hits `session.sendMessage` (sending, the reaction round-trip)
  throws — those stay on the two-client `chat-p2p-pair` suite. `deleteSession`
  (delete-conversation) works because its `startSession` is catch-wrapped and it
  proceeds to the local teardown regardless.
- **Cleanup is free** — everything lands in the per-test fresh `userDataDir`.

## Rules

- **Page Objects over raw selectors** — all UI interaction goes through page objects
- **`TEST_IDS` for data-testid** — shared between `src/` components and `e2e/` tests, never hardcode strings
- **`clearAppData()` before every test** — for fresh-per-test projects (smoke/auth/`@isolated`); the `authenticated` worker session uses the soft-reset instead (`helpers/reset-state.ts`)
- **Parallelism is opt-in per project, controlled by the npm scripts.** Most projects run parallel at the config default `CI ? 2 : '50%'` (their scripts pass no `--workers`): **authenticated, chat, product-sdk, link-navigation, browser**. `authenticated`/`product-sdk` reuse one signed-in Electron per worker, each claiming its own permanent deterministic identity by `parallelIndex` (no pool, no cross-worker collision — see "Bot identities" below); `chat` draws its per-run singleton on worker 0 and attests a fresh random identity on every other worker, and its pair tests draw distinct pairs from the chat-pair pool (`CHAT_PAIR_POOL_SIZE`, claimed per worker by `pairAssignment`); `link-navigation`/`browser` are no-auth with isolated per-worker `userDataDir`s. **Only `smoke`, `auth`, and `security` pin `--workers=1`** — `security` because concurrent Electron teardown hangs on the macOS runner, `auth` to avoid concurrent signing-bot pairing, `smoke` as a quick serial gate. Override anywhere with `E2E_WORKERS` or `--workers`
- **Soft-reset baseline snapshot** (`resetToAuthenticatedBaseline`) — `localStorage` is snapshotted right after the worker signs in (`captureLocalStorageBaseline`) and the per-test reset is `localStorage.clear()` + restore that snapshot, plus `sessionStorage.clear()`. It names **no storage keys** — not the session's, not the app's. New persisted localStorage state therefore needs no change here, and a test that mutates a baseline key (theme, settings) is rolled back too. IndexedDB is still cleared per store, so **new object stores do need registering** (app-DB stores `products`, `dashboardLayouts`, `aliasPermissions`, `productPermissions`, `productLocalStorage`, `productExecutableCache`; the `p2p-chat` + `products-chat` DBs)
- **Never spell a dotNS suffix in a test.** Feature files carry the product **label**; the step completes it through `productName` from `helpers/dotns.ts` (see writing-tests 7a). The suffix is per-environment, so a hardcoded one passes on one channel and resolves nothing on the next
- **Allure tags in .feature files** — control report hierarchy, not file paths
- **`@allure.id:<n>` links a scenario to TestOps plan 900** — scenario name = `TC-x.y.z <title>`, one id per scenario (see writing-tests "Linking a scenario to its TestOps case" and the case map in `docs/regression-testplan-900-cases.md`)
- **`@manual-permissions` tag** — opts out of the renderer-side permission/alias dialog auto-approver (see writing-tests section 6). Use only when the test asserts on the dialog itself
- **`suiteTitle: false`** in Allure config — suite names come only from Gherkin tags
- **`BOT_TOKEN` at build time** — signing bot auth token baked into the e2e build via `npm run build:e2e`
- **Bot identities.** `auth`, `authenticated`, and `product-sdk` use **permanent deterministic users** — `<base><workerLetter?><osSuffix>` (e.g. `desktopauthdamacos`), attested once ever; `ensure()` is an instant check on every later run. `authenticated`/`product-sdk` bases are fixture constants in `e2e/fixtures/base.ts` (`desktopauthd` / `desktopsdk` + `parallelIndex` letter); `auth` scenarios declare the base **in the .feature file** via `… via signing bot on "nightly" as "desktopauth"` (the no-`as` step variant uses a fresh random identity). Explicit usernames in `.feature` files are allowed for permanent identities — write the base name only; the OS suffix is appended by `permanentBotUsername()`. The `chat` project still provisions **fresh random users per run** (`setup-chat`: singleton + `CHAT_PAIR_POOL_SIZE` pairs) because on-chain chat state must not bleed between scenarios or runs; `teardown-bot-users` deletes only those.
- **Heal:** a permanent user wedged in pairing (`StuckPairingError` — chain redeploy) or rejected with the "Limit Reached" no-free-slots error (`PairingLimitError` — exhausted 10/day allowance-slot budget, detected fast from the onboarding error panel; retries abort immediately since the budget is daily) is deleted on the bot and the run falls back to a fresh identity; the next run recreates the permanent user with one attestation (`signInWithHeal` in `e2e/helpers/sign-in.ts`).
- Auth steps use `"the user pairs via signing bot on {environmentId}"` / `"the user is signed in on {environmentId} via signing bot"`, optionally suffixed `as "<permanentBase>"` (where `{environmentId}` is a `VITE_ENVIRONMENTS` channel key — currently `nightly` or `unstable`; see `e2e/helpers/environment.ts`).
- **Failure artifacts** — fresh-per-test projects (smoke/auth/browser/link-nav) use the test-scoped `electronApp` fixture from `base.ts`: on failure it attaches `screenshot` (PNG) and, on retry (`testInfo.retry > 0`), a `recordVideo` `.webm`. The `authenticated` worker session attaches a per-test failure `screenshot` against the shared app; the app is shut down once at worker teardown (not per test), so retry-video isn't recorded for it. `@isolated` and `product-sdk` `@isolated` paths get a fresh app + per-test screenshot.
- **Cucumber VS Code extension** — configured via `.vscode/settings.json` for step navigation

## Keeping Docs Up to Date

When making changes to E2E tests, update these docs:

- **This file (`e2e/CLAUDE.md`)** — update when changing rules, conventions, fixture API, step patterns, or adding new test
  projects. This file is the source of truth for AI-assisted test writing.
- **`e2e/README.md`** — update when changing architecture, directory structure, adding new projects, or modifying the execution
  flow diagram. This file is the source of truth for developers.
- **`src/shared/test-ids.ts`** — add new IDs here when adding `data-testid` to components. Never hardcode test ID strings.
- **`playwright.config.ts`** — only when adding a new project or a feature that needs a new step file; feature files
  in an existing project folder are picked up by that project's glob automatically.

Changes that require doc updates:

| Change                                | Update                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New test project (e.g. `performance`) | Both docs + `playwright.config.ts` + `package.json` scripts                           |
| New fixture (e.g. worker-scoped)      | Both docs (fixture API section)                                                       |
| New Page Object                       | `e2e/README.md` (directory structure)                                                 |
| New convention or rule                | `e2e/CLAUDE.md` (Rules section)                                                       |
| New npm script                        | Both docs (Commands section) + `CLAUDE.md` (Commands section)                         |
| New `data-testid`                     | `src/shared/test-ids.ts` only (docs describe the pattern, not individual IDs)         |
| A deployment's dotNS TLD changes      | `e2e/helpers/dotns.ts` only — one map, no test edits (or `E2E_DOTNS_TLD` for one run) |
