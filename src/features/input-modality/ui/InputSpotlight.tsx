 * those open on every screen to serve a closed overlay is exactly the
 * subscription this shell exists to defer — see `react-best-practices`
 * § Defer State Reads to Usage Point.
 *
 * The surface has no shortcut of its own. Cmd/Ctrl+T, Cmd/Ctrl+L and Cmd/Ctrl+K
 * already meant "I want to type an address", and all three raise
 * `focusAddressBarSideEffect`, which this feature handles — so the browser's
 * existing menu accelerators open it, and those fire even when focus is inside a
