 * The identity is read from the product's own manifest, never from the thing
 * being framed, which is what makes spoofing structurally impossible: a product
 * can write any text it likes and still cannot present it as coming from another.
 *
 * Drawing the icon is not the fetch RFC-0027 § Security forbids. That rule bars
 * resolving *candidate-supplied* URLs to render the list, because the request
 * tells the product's server that this user saw this candidate. A manifest icon
 * is host-side identity for a product the user already installed,
 * content-addressed, and already cached by the dashboard and tab strip — it
 * discloses nothing the query itself did not.
