 * can honestly attribute a candidate, saying it once and clearly is the point of
 * the frame rather than decoration on it.
 *
 * Inside, the answers hang off a timeline: one rail down the left with a dot per
 * answer, each chunk keeping its own hover and its own press target. A rail says
 * "these are several things from one source" where a stack of dividers said
 * "these are several sources" — which was the opposite of what the card means.
