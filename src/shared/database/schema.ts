// which permission slots it holds — a question the core's point-lookup API cannot
// answer. Indexes only, no `.upgrade()`. Rows written before v9 carry none of the new
// columns and are backfilled once at bootstrap, not here: decoding a key needs the
// TrUAPI codec, and `@/shared` may not know TrUAPI vocabulary.

// every permission decision and persists it through the host's own `coreStorage`
// callbacks, so a second host-side copy could only disagree with it. `null` deletes the
// store. Decisions already made are NOT migrated: the core has never seen them, and
// re-prompting is the honest outcome of the host no longer being an authority.
