// While the dependency is still loading, the dependent read has no params, so it
// never started — and an unstarted `useRead` reports `pending: false` with its
// default value. Consumers correctly read that as "settled with nothing" and render
// an empty or error state that then flips to real data a moment later.

// `enabled` is what the caller actually asked for. When nothing was requested there
// is nothing to wait on, and claiming pending would stall a caller that never wanted
// a read at all.
