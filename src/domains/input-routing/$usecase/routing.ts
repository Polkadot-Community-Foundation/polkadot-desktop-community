 * behaviour. Named for the question it asks, not for whoever answers it today.
 *

 * registered from outside the domain, and the public surface may not re-export
 * `gateway.ts`. The gateway takes the answer as a parameter instead, so the wire

 * entry, `renderChatCustomMessage`, and nothing generic; an input candidate has
 * no equivalent. **This is an SDK gap, not a host decision.**
 *
 * The transformer is shaped like the subscription that will replace it — a

 * one when its state changes — so the real method drops in without moving the
