/**
 * File upload for P2P chat using the HOP (Handoff Pool) protocol.
 *
 * Upload: file bytes → encrypted chunks → HOP relay → { identifier, claimTicket }
 *
 * HOP methods (hop_submit, hop_claim) are served by the bulletin chain node,
 * not the statement store people chain.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: The HOP pool is per-node (not replicated across chain nodes).
 * All devices must connect to the same bulletin node for file transfer to work.
 * We use createWsJsonRpcProvider directly (bypassing chainRegistry) with a
 * single-endpoint URL to avoid load-balancer routing to different nodes.
 *
 * Endpoints arrive as a parameter — resolving them is `chat/$usecase/fileTransfer.ts`'s
 * job, because a gateway may not call a use case.
 *
 * There is no download counterpart: the HOP claim is one-shot, so claiming on
 * desktop would deny the mobile recipient. `AttachmentRenderer` renders a
 * placeholder instead.

// TODO(p2p-chat): paseo-next uses a Cloudflare-proxied URL that may route different desktop
// clients to different bulletin chain nodes. Files uploaded on node A are inaccessible from
// node B, causing image/file downloads to fail between desktops. Fix requires one of:
//   1. Replace with a direct single-node URL (like preview/stable)
//   2. Configure Cloudflare sticky sessions for this endpoint
//   3. Replicate the HOP pool across bulletin chain nodes
// Android/iOS get their endpoint from Firebase Remote Config which may already point to a
// specific node — explaining why mobile→desktop file sending works.
